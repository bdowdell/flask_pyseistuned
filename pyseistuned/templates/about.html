        <strong>PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup></strong> is a tool for calculating seismic tuning wedges. Input the velocity
        and density properties of the wedge layers, specify the wavelet parameters, and a synthetic tuning wedge and
        tuning curve are generated.

    <p>
        The initial release, <strong>PySeisTuned<sup>1.0</sup></strong>, was inspired by Agile Scientific's
        <a href="https://github.com/agile-geoscience/xlines/blob/master/notebooks/00_Synthetic_wedge_model.ipynb"
           target="_blank">"X Lines of Code"</a> Jupyter Notebook series and was written as a standalone GUI using
        Python 3 and PyQT5. In this iteration, a user needs to create a virtual conda environment using the provided
        environment.yml file and then launch the app from a command line prompt. While this works, it probably isn't
        the most user-friendly deployment. PySeisTuned<sup>1.0</sup> is open source and licensed under GPL-3.0 for
        compatibility with PyQT5 licensing.

        Enter <strong>PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup></strong>, which is now a web app! The PyQT5 GUI is gone and now
        PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup> runs using Python 3, Flask, HTML5, Bootstrap, & JavaScript. PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup>
        is open source and licensed under the Apache-2.0 license. My primary goal in re-writing PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup>
        as a web app is to make the tool as easy as possible to use. Web apps have changed the way we interact with software
        and simplifies end-user consumption. To me, this means removing the environmental setup
        steps necessary to run PySeisTuned<sup>1.0</sup> and also removing the need to launch from a terminal. In fact,
        unless you want to clone the repository locally to customize PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup>, there is no longer any
        "installation" steps required to get running!

        Flask is a powerful and easy to use Python-based web app framework that connects the Python code in the
        background with the HTML5 user-interface.  Styling is made simple by utilizing Bootstrap pre-built CSS style
        sheets. Additionally, some custom JavaScript is required to enable features such as a reset button, displaying
        Acoustic Impedance of input layer properties, and displaying the apparent frequency of the specified Ricker
        wavelet. One more enhancement is that all plotting is now done using Bokeh instead of Matplotlib. Using Bokeh
        enables embedding feature-rich, interactive plots that are more appropriate in a web app.

    <h1>Seismic Tuning Theory Basics</h1>
    <p>
        Seismic Tuning Thickness as a concept is a basic geophysical tenet and is crucial in understanding the seismic
        response. The seismic tuning phenomenon arises from constructive interference of reflected waves at layer
        interfaces as the bed thickness between the layer begins to thin. As the bed begins to thin, the reflection from
        the top interface and the bottom interface begin to align and constructively interfere. At a certain point, the
        constructive interference between the two layers will reach a maximum and this is known as the
        <strong>Seismic Tuning Thickness</strong> and is the layer thickness below which the top and base reflections
        are no longer indistinguishable from one another.
    </p>
    <p>
        Widess (1973) published the seminal work on the topic titled <em>"How thin is a thin bed?"</em>, which sought to
        dispel common misconceptions about thin bed resolvability. In the paper, Widess considers two identical wavelets
        offset by a time delay. The two wavelets effectively represent the reflections from the top and base of a layer
        while the time delay effectively represents the bed thickness in Two-Way Time (TWT). Several very important
        definitions arise from Widess's paper:
    </p>
    <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Onset of Tuning Thickness</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">&lambda;/2</dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Tuning Thickness</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">&lambda;/4</dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Limit of resolution</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">&lambda;/8</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        where &lambda; is the velocity-dependent wavelength of the layer's dominant frequency.  Recall the relationship
        between frequency, velocity, and wavelength:
    </p>
    <math>
        f = v/&lambda;
    </math>
    <p>
        where f is Frequency in Hz, v is velocity in (m or ft)/sec, and &lambda; is wavelength in (m or ft). This
        equation commonly gets rewritten as:
    </p>
    <math>
        &lambda; = v/f
    </math>
    <p>
        because we typically have an idea about what the velocity and frequency of our zone of interest is and instead
        want to know wavelength. Once we know the wavelength we can then estimate the tuning parameters using Widess's
        definitions above.
