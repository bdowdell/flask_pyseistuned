    <p>
        <strong>PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup></strong> is a simple tool for calculating seismic tuning wedges. Input the velocity and density
        properties of the wedge layers, specify the wavelet parameters, and a synthetic tuning wedge and tuning
        curve are generated.
    </p>
    <p>
        The initial release, <strong>PySeisTuned<sup>1.0</sup></strong>, was inspired by
        <a href="https://github.com/agile-geoscience/xlines/blob/master/notebooks/00_Synthetic_wedge_model.ipynb" target="_blank">
            Agile Scientific's</a> "X Lines of Code" Jupyter Notebook
        series and was written as a standalone GUI using Python 3 and PyQT5. In this iteration, a user needs
        to create a virtual conda environment using the provided environment.yml file and then launch the app from a command
        line prompt. While this works, it probably isn't the most user-friendly deployment. PySeisTuned<sup>1.0</sup>
        is open source and licensed under GPL-3.0 for compatibility with PyQT5 licensing.  The source code is available
        at my GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/bdowdell/PySeisTuned" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <p>
        Enter <strong>PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup></strong>, which is now a web app! The PyQT5 GUI is gone and now
        PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup> runs using Python 3, Flask, HTML5, & Bootstrap. <strong>PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup></strong>
        is open source and licensed under the Apache-2.0 license.  The source code is available at my GitHub repository
        <a href="https://github.com/bdowdell/flask_pyseistuned" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        My primary goal in re-writing <strong>PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup></strong> as a web app is to make the tool as
        easy as possible to use. Web apps have changed the way we interact with software and simplifies end-user
        consumption. Flask is a powerful and easy to use Python-based web app framework that connects the Python-based
        code in the background with the HTML5 user-interface.  Styling is made simple by utilizing Bootstrap pre-built
        CSS style sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Contributions, suggestions, and bug reports are all welcome! I hope you enjoy using the tool and please
        let me know if there ways I can make it even better:
