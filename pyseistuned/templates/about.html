    <p>
        PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup> is a simple tool for calculating seismic tuning wedges. Input the velocity and density
        properties of the wedge layers, specify the wavelet parameters, and a synthetic tuning wedge and tuning
        curve are generated.

        The initial release, PySeisTuned<sup>1.0</sup>, was inspired by Agile Scientific's "X Lines of Code"
        <a href="https://github.com/agile-geoscience/xlines/blob/master/notebooks/00_Synthetic_wedge_model.ipynb" target="_blank">
            Jupyter Notebook</a>
        series and was written as a standalone GUI using Python 3 and PyQT5. In this iteration, a user needed
        to create a virtual conda environment using a provided environment.yml file and launch the app from a command
        line prompt. While this works, it probably isn't the most user-friendly deployment. PySeisTuned<sup>1.0</sup>
        is open source and licensed under GPL-3.0 for compatibility with PyQT5 licensing.  The source code is available
        at my GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/bdowdell/PySeisTuned" target="_blank">here</a>.

        Enter PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup>, which is now a web app (and also my first)! The PyQT5 GUI is gone and now
        PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup> runs using Python 3, Flask, HTML5, & Bootstrap. As always, PySeisTuned<sup>2.0</sup>
        is open source and licensed under the Apache-2.0 license.  The source code is available at my GitHub repository
        <a href="https://github.com/bdowdell/flask_pyseistuned" target="_blank">here</a>.

        Contributions, suggestions, and bug reports are all welcome! I hope you enjoy using the tool and please
        let me know if there ways I can make it even better.
